# Inventory Management System

This Python script provides functionality for managing inventory in a shop or startup. It allows users to add, update, and remove items from the inventory, as well as view items with low stock levels and surplus items. The system is implemented using SQLite for data storage and provides a simple command-line interface.

- **Inventory Operations:**
  - Add a new item to the inventory.
  - Update the available amount of a stock item.
  - View all items in stock.
  - View items that are more than the required amount.
  - View items with less than their required amount.
